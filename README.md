 # Starting Backend app 
 
Before Running this application make sure you have mongoDB installed in your system. 
Once installed, open cmd and run 'mongod' command to start the mongo server. 
Once the server has been started, go to ECM-Backend/ECM/ directory and open cmd. 
Run "npm install" which will install all the dependency for backend server. 
After npm install is done, run "npm start" command in cmd to start the backend server. 
If you see this message in the console, then the server has been started successfully - ***************app is running and connected to mongoose*****************  


# Starting Frontend App 

Go to ECM-Frontend/ECM/ directory and open cmd. 
Run "npm install" command which will install the required dependencies of angular. 
Once it is done, start the server by command "ng s --o" 
Application will start running in your default browser.
